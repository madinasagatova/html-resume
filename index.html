    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>My name is Madina Sagatova. I hold a Master's degree (Level 9) in Data Analytics from CCT College Dublin, with 
        coursework in Advanced Data Analysis, Machine Learning, Programming, Big Data, and Statistics. I also have a Higher
        Diploma in Computer Science. My academic background has equipped me with strong analytical and problem-solving skills,
        along with hands-on experience in statistical analysis and data presentation. 
    </p>
      
    <p>Currently, I am further expanding my skill set by studying full-stack web development through an intensive Udemy
        course covering HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Node.js, React, PostgreSQL, Web3, and DApps. I am eager to leverage my knowledge
        and practical experience to contribute to data-driven decision-making as a Data Analyst, while continuing to develop my 
        technical skills in a professional environment.

        <strong>A Comparative Analysis of CNN, MobileNetV2, and VGG-16 for Potato Leaf Disease Classification:A Big Data Approach Using Hadoop and Apache Spark (Python, Neural Network and Big Data)</strong>
        <ul>
            <li><a href="https://github.com/madinasagatova/Potato-Leaf-Disease-Detection">GitHub Source Code</a></li>
            <li>To handle large datasets and accelerate processing, Hadoop was used for distributed data storage and Apache Spark was employed for parallelized data processing and model training</li>
            <li>Custom CNN, VGG-16 and MobileNetV2 were created and validated to classify potato leaf diseases effectively. The study found that using 10 epochs three models provided the accuracies 0.93, 0.93 and 0.94 respectively for CNN, VGG-16 and MobileNetV2.</li>
